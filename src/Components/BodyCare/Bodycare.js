         Skin Care is the latest non-invasive skin resurfacing and rejuvenation system that combines soothing and invigorating spa therapies with advanced medical technology to achieve instant, lasting results.

The HydraFacial treatment is the only hydradermabrasion procedure that combines cleansing, exfoliation, extraction, hydration and antioxidant protection simultaneously.

This combination of microdermabrasion and chemical exfoliation, not only improves the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, acne, pores and hyper-pigmentation, but also helps slow down the aging process of the skin.

Each treatment uses a series of HydroPeel® tips – Each one has multiple peeling edges to exfoliate the skin several times each pass, achieving better, more even results. The unique spiral design creates a vortex effect to easily dislodge and remove impurities while simultaneously introducing hydrating skin solutions with potent antioxidants.
